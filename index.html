        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.
            
            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education in India</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
            For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.
            I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it might turn out to be too late.
            Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.
            Also, in the +2 scheme students should be very well allowed to study different subjects from any stream because in the 21st century no subject will survive in isolation, it is very much integrated hence no boundaries of ‘Stream’ should prevail…
            For example, financial technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming fields from different subject specializations.
            A shift from the theoretical framework to a practical framework will certainly help the cause.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">"Living Together, Growing Together" had commercial success as a single performed by The 5th Dimension. The single, produced by Bones Howe and arranged by Bob Alcivar and Artie Butler, reached #5 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart, #9 on the Canadian adult contemporary chart, and #32 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973, marking the band's last Top 40 hit. It was featured on their 1973 album, Living Together, Growing Together.
            I do understand that in a country as big and diverse as ours it is surely “easier said than done” but it surely should be on the top of the government bucket list.
            Small steps can be taken if the whole “revolution” seems unfeasible. Sports and Yoga too are great ideas that very well should be incorporated in the school curriculum and the govt is doing good on this…
            Lastly, education as rightly is incomplete with the right value sets… somewhat a spirit of coordination should prevail over competition among students today which largely seems missing… a rat race for marks only highlights the state of education as on now…
